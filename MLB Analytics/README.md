This folder contains the progression of a project centered around MLB player's Batting Average vs. their expected Batting Average. The 2022season folder contains a post-season analysis of how each player performed, and compared that to their expected performance. In the 2023season folder, I take a step further and generate projections for the 2024 season as well as fine tuning the model by introducing new factors.


Each folder contains the raw code, the html version of the code, and the written report which dives deep into the findings of the code.
