**Analytical Projects Repository**
Welcome to my Analytical Projects Repository! This repository is a collection of various data analysis and prediction projects that I have worked on during my free time after graduating. Each project focuses on different aspects of data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques to extract insights from data and generate meaningful predictions.

**Overview**
The repository contains projects that apply various analytical techniques to real-world problems. The main goal is to explore datasets, perform data cleaning and exploration, apply statistical analysis or machine learning models, and generate predictions or insights.

**Current Projects**
MLB Player Batting Average Analysis:
In this project, I analyze Major League Baseball (MLB) players' expected batting average vs. their true batting average. I use historical data to calculate each player's expected performance and then compare it with their actual performance. Additionally, I generate predictions for the players' batting average in the upcoming season based on the analysis.

**Upcoming Projects**
I plan to continue adding more projects, ranging from sports analytics to financial forecasting, machine learning, and general data exploration. Stay tuned for future updates!
